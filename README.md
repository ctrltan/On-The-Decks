# On The Decks
On The Decks is a React and NodeJS project that uses Spotify API.

Some of the best music I've heard was found in DJ sets: remixed, sampled or distorted. It
has expanded my musical palette and opened me up to artists and genres I didn't even know existed.

I wanted to create a fun way to understand how much of the music space you currently listen to and what
genres you might want to explore next, replicating that experience of finding a new song on a DJ set!
